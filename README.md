# iCSHD
A light-weighted customer support health dashboard empowered by CXD spirit and AI technology. This project is a one of the Microsoft 2019 Hackathon projects.

## Overview
By using the tool, engineers can quickly identify customers' mood and needs which helps to deliver a more tailored and timely service experience. We plan to create the product by applying natural-language-processing technology to the text data and utilize other valuable information. Additionally, we plan to build a simple and intuitive user interface that is light-weighted and easy to use.

### Currently, we focus on:

#### 1. Building a friendly user interface
UI designers and front-end programmers are needed.
	
#### 2. Data processing
Datasets include the Service Desk and CSS BI Dataset. We want to generate some insights from the data to improve our service.

#### 3. Utilizing AI technology
There are many AI resources available on Azure platform we can leverage on.

### Main Functions
For each engineer, one can view all of the customers they are working with on the iCSHD dashboard. With each customers, iCSHD will provide valuable information based on the historical data such as emails, CPE and other information we can find in the dataset. The following dimensions are being considered.

* Recent CPE
* Case Age
* Customers' ongoing cases
* Customers' sentiment
* Cutural understandings

...

Based on the points above, a score will be generated indicating the possible CPE the engineer might receive. The probability of how likly the customer will do the survey will also be caculated.
